## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd TaskBuddy/backend
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` file with your configuration:
```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=taskbuddy
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRE=7d

EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password

FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 4: Set Up Database
```bash
# Create database
createdb taskbuddy

# Run database schema (will be created in next phase)
psql -d taskbuddy -f database/schema.sql
```

### Step 5: Start the Server
```bash
# Development mode with auto-restart
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User registers or logs in
2. Server generates JWT token
3. Client stores token
4. Token sent in Authorization header: `Bearer <token>`
5. Middleware verifies token for protected routes

## 📡 API Endpoints (To be implemented)

- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user

### Users
- `GET /api/users` - Get all family members
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user by ID
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user profile
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user

### Tasks
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create task
- `GET /api/tasks` - Get all tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/:id` - Get task by ID
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update task
